# Everything in this section will be available as an environment variable

# You can also add other sections if you like.
# The contents of sections as shown below will not become environment variables,
# but they'll be easily accessible from within Streamlit anyway as we show
# later in this doc.

# Everything is accessible via the st.secrets dict:

st.write("DB username:", st.secrets["db_username"])
st.write("DB password:", st.secrets["db_password"])
st.write("My cool secrets:", st.secrets["my_cool_secrets"]["things_i_like"])

# And the root-level secrets are also accessible as environment variables:


st.write(
    "Has environment variables been set:",
    os.environ["db_username"] == st.secrets["db_username"],
)
